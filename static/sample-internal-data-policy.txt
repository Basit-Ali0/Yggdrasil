INTERNAL DATA HANDLING POLICY
Acme Corp — Effective January 2025
Version 2.1

============================================================
Section 1: Data Classification and Access Control
============================================================

1.1 All customer data must be classified into one of four tiers:
    Public, Internal, Confidential, or Restricted.

1.2 Access to Confidential and Restricted data requires multi-factor
    authentication (MFA). Any account accessing these tiers without
    MFA enabled constitutes a CRITICAL violation.

1.3 Employee accounts must be deactivated within 24 hours of
    termination. Any data access by a terminated employee account
    is a HIGH severity violation.

1.4 Third-party contractor accounts must not have access to
    Restricted data. If a contractor account has access to
    Restricted-tier data, flag as CRITICAL.

============================================================
Section 2: Encryption Requirements
============================================================

2.1 All customer data stored in databases must be encrypted at
    rest using AES-256 or equivalent. Unencrypted storage of
    customer PII is a CRITICAL violation.

2.2 All data transmitted between services must use TLS 1.2 or
    higher. Any service endpoint transmitting data without TLS
    is a HIGH severity violation.

2.3 API keys, passwords, and secret tokens must never be stored
    in plaintext database columns. Detection of plaintext secrets
    in any data store is a CRITICAL violation.

============================================================
Section 3: Data Retention and Deletion
============================================================

3.1 Customer data must not be retained beyond 5 years from the
    date of last activity unless required by legal hold.

3.2 When a customer requests deletion of their data, all
    associated records must be purged within 30 calendar days.
    Records marked for deletion but not yet purged after 30 days
    constitute a HIGH severity violation.

3.3 Backup data containing customer PII must follow the same
    retention schedule. Backups older than 5 years must be
    securely destroyed.

============================================================
Section 4: Audit and Monitoring
============================================================

4.1 All access to Confidential and Restricted data must be
    logged in an immutable audit trail. Systems without audit
    logging enabled are in violation of this policy (HIGH severity).

4.2 Backup operations must complete at least once every 24 hours.
    Any critical system without a backup in the last 24 hours
    is a HIGH severity violation.

4.3 Security incidents must be reported within 4 hours of
    detection. Unreported incidents exceeding this window are
    CRITICAL violations.

============================================================
Section 5: Cross-Border Data Transfers
============================================================

5.1 Customer data originating from the European Economic Area
    must not be processed or stored in regions outside the EEA
    unless covered by Standard Contractual Clauses (SCCs) or an
    adequacy decision.

5.2 Any data transfer to a region without an approved legal
    basis is a CRITICAL violation.

============================================================
Section 6: Vendor and Third-Party Risk
============================================================

6.1 All third-party vendors with access to customer data must
    complete a security questionnaire annually.

6.2 Vendors that have not completed their annual review within
    the last 12 months must have their access suspended until
    the review is complete.
