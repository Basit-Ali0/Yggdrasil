Problem Statement:

Objective

  Build a software-only solution that ingests free-text PDF policy documents and connects to a company database. It should automatically identify records that violate compliance rules and business policies as outlined in the requirements. Optional human oversight can be incorporated during the data analysis phase. The agent must support periodic monitoring to detect future policy violations.

 

Challenge
Compliance requirements and business policies are often stored as unstructured documents, while company data changes frequently. Your mission is to create a platform that:

 

  - Ingests and interprets PDF policy documents to extract actionable compliance rules

  - Connects to and scans a company database for compliance and business rule violations

  - Flags detected violations with clear, explainable justifications

  - Incorporates human review and intervention wherever needed

  - Periodically monitors data for new or recurring violations

 

  You may optionally add features to:

   - Suggest remediation steps for detected violations

  - Summarize compliance status and trends over time

  - Present findings via dashboards or automated reporting

  - Generate audit-ready compliance reports

 

Tools Allowed
Any software-based stack — no hardware required.

 

  Key Focus

  Accurate, explainable, and continuous data policy enforcement with actionable insights.
