## Hackathon Integration Opportunities

### Option 1: No Direct API Integration (Recommended for MVP)

Turgon AI does **NOT** have public APIs — they are a services/consulting company. For the hackathon:

1. **Mention as Sponsor** — Credit Turgon AI as the hackathon sponsor
2. **Conceptual Alignment** — Their data governance services align conceptually with compliance scanning
3. **Future Integration** — If they offer APIs post-hackathon, integrate later

### Option 2: Post-Hackathon Integration

If Turgon AI releases APIs in the future:

| Potential Integration | Description |
|---------------------|-------------|
| **Policy Document Analysis** | Use their agents to parse policy documents |
| **Data Classification** | Leverage their data governance for PII detection |
| **Automated Remediation** | Their agents could help implement fixes |

## What to Say in Demo

> "Turgon AI's focus on data governance aligns with our mission. While they operate as a services company without public APIs, Yggdrasil demonstrates the kind of automated compliance enforcement that their AI agents could potentially integrate with in the future."
